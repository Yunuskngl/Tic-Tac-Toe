# Tic-Tac-Toe
Hello Everyone, Basically I made a Tic Tac Toe game. After running the program, you can start the game with the outputs. It works in the same logic as the classic Tic Tac Toe game. You will see a 3x3 table. You will place 'X' and 'O' characters in the boxes respectively.
Combining 3 identical characters in a line wins the game.


#####Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
